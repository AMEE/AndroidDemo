AMEE Demo for Android
=====================

This is a very simple demo that demonstrates how AMEE's java client library can be used to
create and android app. The app itself simply asks for two drill down choices and creates
an AMEE profile item inside a new profile (creating a new profile each time isn't efficient,
but keeps the code simple).

The AMEE client library and all other dependencies can be found in the libs dir, so you might
want to check if a new version of the client library is available from here:

https://github.com/AMEE/amee-lib-java/

It also has examples of how to use the client library beyond what is shown in this simple demo.

The demo should work on any Android version, but I've tested it on 1.6 (donut) and 2.3.3 
(gingerbread).
